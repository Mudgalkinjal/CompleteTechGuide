# CAP Theorem

CAP Theorem defines the trade-offs in distributed systems between Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.

* * *

## 1\. What Is CAP Theorem?

**CAP Theorem** states that a distributed system can guarantee only two out of three properties simultaneously:

* *   **Consistency (C)**: All nodes see the same data at the same time.
* *   **Availability (A)**: Every request receives a response, without guarantee it contains the most recent data.
* *   **Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues to operate despite network partitions.

* * *

## 2\. Understanding the Trade-Offs

### 2.1 Consistency vs. Availability

* *   **When Consistency is prioritized**:* *   System may reject some requests during network issues to maintain up-to-date data.
* *   **When Availability is prioritized**:* *   System responds to all requests even if data may be stale.

### 2.2 The Role of Partition Tolerance

* *   **Partition Tolerance** is non-negotiable in distributed systems.
* *   **Design Implication**:* *   In case of a network split, you must choose between consistency and availability.

                           |
          +----------------+----------------+
          |                                 |
  Prioritize Consistency           Prioritize Availability
  (Some requests may fail)       (Data may be outdated)
```

## 3\. Best Practices & Key Considerations

* *   **Know Your Application Needs**:* *   Critical transactions (e.g., banking) may require strong consistency.
*     * *   User-facing apps (e.g., social media) may favor availability.
* *   **Design for Partitioning**:* *   Always assume network failures and plan your strategy accordingly.
* *   **Hybrid Approaches**:* *   Use techniques like eventual consistency for non-critical data and strict consistency for critical operations.

* * *

## 4\. Summary

* *   **CAP Theorem** forces a choice between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance in distributed systems.
* *   Since partition tolerance is essential, the trade-off is between consistency and availability.
* *   Choose your approach based on your systemâ€™s specific requirements and tolerance for data staleness or request failures.
