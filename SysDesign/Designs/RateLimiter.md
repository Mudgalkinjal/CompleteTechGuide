# Rate Limiter

# Basic Requirements

* *   **Functional**:
*     
*     * *   Limit requests per client (or API key) over a defined period.
*     * *   Support configurable limits (e.g., 100 requests/minute).
*     * *   Provide fast, low-latency decisions.
* *   **Non-Functional**:
*     
*     * *   Scalability across multiple instances.
*     * *   Consistency in distributed environments.
*     * *   Resilience to failures.

* * *

## 2\. Algorithm Options

* *   **Fixed Window**:
*     
*     * *   Simple counter reset every time window.
*     * *   May cause burst issues at window boundaries.
* *   **Sliding Window/Log**:
*     
*     * *   Tracks timestamps of each request.
*     * *   More precise but costlier in storage.
* *   **Token Bucket/Leaky Bucket**:
*     
*     * *   Allows bursts while enforcing an average rate.
*     * *   Common choice for distributed systems.

* * *

## 3\. High-Level Architecture

1. 1.  **Client** sends a request.
1. 2.  **API Gateway/Service** calls a **Rate Limiter Middleware** before processing.
1. 3.  **Rate Limiter** uses a fast in-memory store (like Redis) to:* *   Store a counter or token bucket per client.
1.     * *   Increment/decrement counters or tokens atomically.
1. 4.  **Decision**:* *   If under limit, allow the request.
1.     * *   Else, reject or delay.

## 4\. Implementation Considerations

* *   **Atomicity**:
*     
*     * *   Use Redis commands like INCR with EXPIRE or Lua scripts for atomic updates.
* *   **Scalability**:
*     
*     * *   Deploy the rate limiter as a distributed cache.
*     * *   Partition keys by client/API key.
* *   **Fallback**:
*     
*     * *   Decide on default behavior (e.g., fail open or closed) if the rate limiter store is unavailable.
* *   **Configuration**:
*     
*     * *   Allow dynamic configuration of limits per endpoint or client.

## 5\. Summary

A rate limiter using a token bucket algorithm in a distributed cache (e.g., Redis) can efficiently enforce request limits. It sits as middleware between clients and services, checking a client’s token count before allowing further processing—ensuring controlled, scalable API usage.

# Advanced Requirements
Distributed Enforcement:
Apply limits across multiple servers/regions.
Synchronize state across instances.
Fine-Grained Control:
Per-client, per-endpoint, and global rate limits.
Support dynamic configuration and burst handling.
Low Latency & High Throughput:
Fast decision-making using in-memory data stores.
Resilience & Fallbacks:
Handle cache store failures gracefully.
Support degraded modes without compromising overall system availability.
Observability:
Monitor rate limiting events, rejections, and performance metrics.
2. Core Algorithms & Techniques
Token Bucket Algorithm:
Allows bursts while enforcing an average rate.
Tokens are replenished at a defined rate.
Sliding Window Counters:
Provides more accurate rate limiting over continuous intervals.
Can be implemented using Redis Sorted Sets.
Hybrid Approach:
Use local in-process caches for quick decisions at the edge, then synchronize with a central store.
3. High-Level Architecture
3.1 Components
Edge/API Gateway Rate Limiter:
Performs initial, low-latency checks.
Uses local caches to quickly allow or reject requests.
Central Rate Limiter Service:
Maintains global counters and token buckets.
Uses a distributed in-memory store (e.g., Redis Cluster, or a highly available NoSQL database) to store and update counters atomically.
Atomic Operations with Lua Scripts:
Use Redis Lua scripting to guarantee atomic updates for token replenishment and consumption.
Configuration & Dynamic Updates:
A configuration service to update limits per client, endpoint, or region in real time.
Fallback & Degraded Mode:
In case the central store is unavailable, edge nodes switch to a pre-configured local rate limiter that uses approximate counts.

Edge Layer: Quickly filters most requests using local counters.
Central Layer: Provides a single source of truth, synchronizing state across nodes.
Atomicity & Synchronization: Ensured by Lua scripts and distributed transactions where necessary.
4. Implementation Considerations
Atomic Counter Updates:
Use Redis commands (e.g., INCR, EXPIRE) combined with Lua scripts to atomically check and update token counts.
Distributed Consistency:
Employ a Redis Cluster or similar to ensure data consistency across nodes.
Dynamic Configuration:
Use a centralized config management system (e.g., Consul, ZooKeeper) for real-time adjustments.
Local Caching:
Use in-process memory for short-term caching on API gateways to reduce load on the central store.
Fallback Behavior:
Decide whether to “fail open” (allow requests) or “fail closed” (reject requests) based on system requirements.
Monitoring & Metrics:
Instrument the rate limiter for real-time analytics (e.g., hit ratios, rejections, latencies) using Prometheus/Grafana.
5. Summary
An advanced rate limiter leverages a hybrid approach—combining edge-level local caching with a central, distributed in-memory store—to provide fine-grained, consistent, and low-latency rate limiting across a distributed system. By employing robust algorithms (token bucket, sliding window), atomic operations (Lua scripts), and dynamic configurations, this design ensures high throughput and resilience while providing critical observability and fallback mechanisms.

This advanced design is well-suited for high-scale environments where distributed clients and microservices need coordinated rate limiting without compromising performance.
