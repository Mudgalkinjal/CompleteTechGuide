# System Design Training

Welcome to the **System Design Training** repository! This project aims to help developers (both beginners and experienced) deepen their understanding of system design concepts and apply them to real-world architectural challenges.


## Overview

System design is about creating architectures that are **scalable**, **reliable**, and **maintainable**. In this repository, we cover **core concepts** alongside **practical design examples**. Whether you're preparing for technical interviews or building large-scale applications, these materials will guide you through the fundamentals and beyond.

### Concepts

The **concepts** folder contains in-depth explanations of the **fundamental building blocks** of system design, such as:
- Scalability
- Reliability & Availability
- Caching Strategies
- Load Balancing
- Databases & Sharding
- And more...

Each file or subfolder within `concepts` addresses a specific topic in detail, providing definitions, diagrams, best practices, and real-world use cases.

### Designs

The **designs** folder showcases **end-to-end architecture examples** for different kinds of applications. For instance:
- **Chat App**: A real-time messaging system handling large volumes of concurrent users.
- **Weather App**: Ingesting external APIs, caching weather data, and handling data consistency across multiple regions.
- Additional designs to illustrate various industry use cases.

Each subfolder includes **diagrams**, **explanations**, and **step-by-step** guides to understand the architectural decisions made for that particular system.
