# PLANNING AND REQUIREMENT GATHERING WITH DEVOPS

### **Planning & Requirement Gathering: Detailed Notes with DevOps Integration**

---

#### **1. Identify Stakeholders**  
- **Key Stakeholders**: Product Owner, End-Users (e.g., personal development enthusiasts), DevOps/Infra Team, QA Team.  
- **DevOps Tools**:  
  - **Collaboration**: Slack/Microsoft Teams for real-time communication.  
  - **Documentation**: Confluence for centralized stakeholder requirements.  

---

#### **2. Collaborate with Stakeholders**  
- **Activities**: Workshops, sprint planning, feedback loops.  
- **DevOps Tools**:  
  - **Project Management**: Jira/Trello for tracking user stories and tasks.  
  - **Version Control**: GitHub/GitLab for shared codebase visibility.  

---

#### **3. Define Goals, Core Purpose, Features**  
- **Example Goals**:  
  - Task Management: CRUD operations, deadlines, priorities.  
  - Rewards System: Points/badges, progress tracking, redemption.  
- **DevOps Alignment**:  
  - Design for scalability (e.g., containerization with Docker).  
  - Plan observability early (metrics/logging tools like Prometheus/ELK).  

---

#### **4. User Stories & Acceptance Criteria**  
- **Task Management Stories**:  
  - *"As a user, I want to create, update, and delete tasks..."*  
    - **Acceptance Criteria**:  
      - API returns 404 if task doesn’t exist (error handling).  
      - Tasks persist after server restart (DB resilience).  
  - **DevOps Tools**:  
    - Automated API testing (Postman/Newman in CI/CD pipelines).  
    - Database backups (AWS RDS automated snapshots).  

- **Rewards System Stories**:  
  - *"As a user, I want to earn points for completing tasks..."*  
    - **Edge Cases**:  
      - Points rollback on task deletion (transactional DB queries).  
    - **DevOps Tools**:  
      - Feature flags (LaunchDarkly) for gradual rewards logic rollout.  

---

#### **5. Scope & Prioritization (MoSCoW)**  
- **MVP Features (Must-Have)**:  
  - Task CRUD, points calculation, basic UI.  
- **Exclusions (Won’t Have)**:  
  - Social sharing, advanced gamification.  
- **DevOps Alignment**:  
  - Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) to ensure MVP infra is scalable.  

---

#### **6. Timeline & Milestone Planning**  
- **Milestones**:  
  - Week 1-2: Auth + Task CRUD API.  
  - Week 3-4: Rewards system + Frontend integration.  
- **DevOps Tools**:  
  - **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions/Jenkins to automate build/test at each milestone.  
  - **Deployment**: Staging environment (AWS ECS) for UAT before production.  

---

#### **7. Risk Assessment**  
- **Risks**:  
  - Unplanned downtime (mitigation: blue-green deployments).  
  - Security breaches (mitigation: RBAC, OWASP scans).  
- **DevOps Tools**:  
  - **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana for uptime tracking.  
  - **Security**: Trivy/Snyk for container vulnerability scanning.  

---

#### **8. Documentation & Communication**  
- **Technical Docs**:  
  - API specs (Swagger/OpenAPI).  
  - Deployment runbooks (Confluence + Terraform modules).  
- **DevOps Culture**:  
  - **Docs-as-Code**: Store infrastructure diagrams in GitHub.  
  - **ChatOps**: Slack integrations with Jenkins for deployment alerts.  

---

#### **9. Tech Stack Selection**  
- **Frontend**: React (hosted on AWS S3/CloudFront).  
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (containerized with Docker).  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (managed via AWS RDS).  
- **DevOps Tools**:  
  - **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (build/test), ArgoCD (GitOps for Kubernetes).  
  - **IaC**: Terraform for AWS ECS/Fargate, RDS, VPC setup.  
  - **Secret Management**: AWS Secrets Manager/HashiCorp Vault.  

---

#### **10. Infrastructure Planning**  
- **Local Development**:  
  - Docker Compose for DB, backend, and frontend containers.  
- **Production**:  
  - AWS ECS/Fargate for container orchestration.  
  - Terraform to auto-provision cloud resources (e.g., ECS clusters, ALB).  
- **DevOps Tools**:  
  - **Logging**: AWS CloudWatch/ELK Stack.  
  - **Networking**: Terraform for VPC, subnets, and security groups.

### **Why DevOps Integration in Planning Matters**  
1. **Early Automation**: CI/CD pipelines reduce manual errors during deployment.  
2. **Scalability**: IaC ensures infra grows with user demand (e.g., auto-scaling groups).  
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Security scans and monitoring are baked into the workflow.  
4. **Collaboration**: Shared tools (GitHub, Jira) align dev and ops teams from Day 1.  

By embedding DevOps practices during planning, you ensure the project is **deployable, observable, and maintainable** from inception.
