# AI & Machine Learning

Welcome to the **AI & Machine Learning** folder! This is a collection of my learning materials, projects, experiments, and notes related to various AI/ML topics. The goal is to have a well-structured, organized place to explore foundations, core algorithms, and practical projects.

### Brief Description of Each Folder

*   **0\_Foundations/**  
    Basic building blocks for AI/ML, including math, statistics, and Python refreshers.
    
*   **1\_Machine\_Learning/**  
    Everything from classic supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to reinforcement learning. Includes code examples and notebooks.
    
*   **2\_Deep\_Learning/**  
    Focus on neural networks (CNN, RNN, Transformers), frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow, and code samples.
    
*   **3\_NLP/**  
    Natural Language Processing tutorials, experiments, and examples (e.g., text classification, language models).
    
*   **4\_Projects/**  
    End-to-end projects showcasing data processing, model training, evaluation, and (possibly) deployment pipelines.
    
*   **5\_Notes\_and\_References/**  
    Summaries of articles, research papers, recommended books, and curated links that have helped in the learning journey.
    
*   **6\_Experiments/**  
    A sandbox for testing code snippets, quick proofs-of-concept, or exploration notebooks that may or may not turn into full projects.

## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Cloning**  
    Feel free to clone or download this repository:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
    ```
    
2.  **Explore Topics**  
    Browse through the subfolders based on the topic you’re interested in. Start from `0_Foundations` if you need a refresher or want to review math and statistics fundamentals.
    
3.  **Run the Code**
    
    *   Many subfolders contain Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) or Python scripts.
    *   A `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` might be present in some folders—install or create a virtual environment before running the code:
        
        ```bash
        
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        _or_
        
        ```bash

        
        conda env create -f environment.yml
        ```
        
    *   Launch Jupyter notebook or your preferred IDE to explore the examples.
4.  **Learning Path**  
    The subfolders are arranged in a rough learning path:
    
    *   **Foundations** → **Machine Learning** → **Deep Learning** → **NLP**.
    *   The **Projects** folder shows how concepts come together in real applications.

* * *

## Prerequisites

*   Basic knowledge of Python programming.
*   A working Python environment (3.7+ recommended).
*   (Optional) Familiarity with libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, or TensorFlow if you want to run advanced examples.
*   (Optional) For NLP or large model training, having GPU support (e.g., CUDA-enabled) can help.

* * *

## Getting Started

1.  **Choose a Topic:** If you’re completely new, start from `0_Foundations/Math_for_AI/` to brush up on fundamental math concepts. If you already know the basics, jump to a topic of interest in Machine Learning or Deep Learning.
    
2.  **Practice with Notebooks:** Many concepts have accompanying Jupyter notebooks. Try running them and modifying the code to deepen your understanding.
    
3.  **Work on Projects:** The `4_Projects` folder contains project examples. Attempt to replicate or modify them to tackle real-world problems.
    
4.  **Add Personal Notes:** As you learn, create or update Markdown files in the `5_Notes_and_References` folder with insights, useful links, or summaries of important papers.
    
5.  **Experiment Freely:** Use the `6_Experiments` folder to quickly prototype ideas without worrying about structure. If a prototype grows into something substantial, you can move it into a dedicated project folder.
